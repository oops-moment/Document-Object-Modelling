# Document-Object-Modelling 
### he Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
## So here are some my code solutons for underatnding how exactly DOM works for given cases:
- 1:Create a button which changes its color on click to [red, green, blue] in that order. The original color of the button should be black
---
- 2:Create a button, which increases and decreases its size within certain bounds uniformly when the cursor is over it. The behaviour should be cyclic.
For example, if the button is at its minimum size and my cursor is over it, it should increase to its maximum size and then start decreasing to its minimum size, etc.
(Assuming the cursor stays on it)
When the cursor is removed, it should stay at whatever size the cursor was removed at.
